// The main pillar blocks of any opps was

Abstraction
  - we group related variable and functions together, hence we can reduce complexity and we can reuse them in differeny parts
  (Reduce complexity + increase reuseability)

inheritance
  - we eliminates the redundant
polymorphism
  - we can refactor ugly switch case statements.
enapsulation
  - we hide the details and complexity and show only the essentials
  (Reduce complexity + isolate the impact of changes)
